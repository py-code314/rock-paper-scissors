2. Paper: represented by an open hand.
3. Scissors: represented by extending the index and middle fingers, forming a V.
 

### Rules
* Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins).
* Scissors cuts Paper (Scissors win).
* Paper covers Rock (Paper wins)
* If both players choose the same shape, the game is a tie.

1. Tie
2. You won!
