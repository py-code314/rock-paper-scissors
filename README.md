### Description
Rock-paper-scissors is a simple hand game usually played between two people, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. Here you are playing against the computer instead of a real person. The three shapes you can make are:

1. Rock: represented by making a fist.
2. Paper: represented by an open hand.
3. Scissors: represented by extending the index and middle fingers, forming a V.
 

### Rules
* Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins).
* Scissors cuts Paper (Scissors win).
* Paper covers Rock (Paper wins)
* If both players choose the same shape, the round is a tie.
